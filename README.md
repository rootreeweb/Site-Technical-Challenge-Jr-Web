### The Requirements:
* All mouseover effects need to work. (Links, Images, etc.)
* The only click events that need to work are switching between posts, tagged(IGTV is not required) and the search field at the top (the search form does not need to be able to actually search).
* The image order, as well as the like and comment counts for each photo, should be randomized.
* The language select at the bottom of the page does not need to change the language of the page, but does need to be populated and selectable.

* The page design must be responsive.
